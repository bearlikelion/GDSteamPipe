# GDSteamPipe

A set of scripts for one-click deployment to Steam for Godot Games using [SteamPipe](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamPipe).\
This repository is meant to be privately forked and customized.

Steam does requires a **plain text** password for steamcmd login, but @echo is off so there is no bat output, making this safe to show on stream (your build account's name will still show).

This tool was designed and developed for my game [SurvivalScape](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2862660/SurvivalScape/).

## Requirements
* [Steam's SDK](https://partner.steamgames.com/downloads/list)

### Windows:
* [7-zip.exe](https://7-zip.org/)

### Linux:
Todo

## Setup
Download and extract the SteamSDK `/sdk/tools/ContentBuilder/` to your game's build directory.

Add your Steam build scripts to the scripts directory, examples are provided in: [/Scripts](./Scripts/).\
These can also be generated by the SteamPipeGUI tool found at: `SteamSDK.zip/sdk/tools/SteamPipe.GUI.zip`

Edit the [_Prep Mac.ps1](./_Prep%20Mac.ps1) Powershell script for your export paths.

Add your **build account's** username and password to the [deploy_main.bat](./deploy_main) and [deploy_demo](./deploy_demo.bat) batch files.

Run!

## Usage
### Windows
* Right click -> Run -> _Prep Mac.ps1 to extract OS X Zip files
* Double click to run the .bat file for each app_id

### Linux
To do.

## Future Features
Automatic Godot Exports from the batch file.\
